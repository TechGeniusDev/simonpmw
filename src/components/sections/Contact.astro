               A candle loses nothing by lighting another candle. But we'll never forget what it took everyone and the village to afford a 2500/= fee per term in high school. Thanks for being there.

               We need each other more than we‚Äôd like to believe. Even the smallest act of kindness is worth more than the grandest intention. By giving a little today, you will help out a lot.
