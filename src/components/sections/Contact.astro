               A candle loses nothing by lighting another candle. We never forgot all it took everyone and the village to afford a 2500/= fee per term in high school. Thanks for being there.

               Truth is, we need each other more than we‚Äôd like to believe.<br />Even the smallest act of kindness is worth more than the grandest intention.<br />By giving a little today, you will help out a lot.
